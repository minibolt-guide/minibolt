The MiniBolt needs to be secured against online attacks using various methods.

## Enabling the Uncomplicated Firewall

A firewall controls what kind of outside traffic your machine accepts and which applications can send data out.
By default, many network ports are open and listening for incoming connections.
Closing unnecessary ports can mitigate many potential system vulnerabilities.

For now, only SSH should be reachable from the outside.
Bitcoin Core and LND are using Tor and don't need incoming ports.
We'll open the port for Electrs and web applications later if needed.

* With user "admin", configure and enable the firewall rules, when the prompt ask you `Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)?` type `y` key and enter

  ```sh
  $ sudo ufw default deny incoming
  ```

  ```sh
  $ sudo ufw default allow outgoing
  ```

  ```sh
  $ sudo ufw allow 22/tcp comment 'allow SSH from anywhere'
  ```

  ```sh
  $ sudo ufw logging off
  ```

  ```sh
  $ sudo ufw enable
  ```

Expected output:

  ```
  > Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
  ```

* Check if the UFW is properly configured and active

  ```sh
  $ sudo ufw status verbose
  ```

Expected output:

  ```
  > Status: active
  > Logging: off
  > Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
  > New profiles: skip

  >
  > To                            Action      From
  > --                            ------      ----
  > 22                            ALLOW       Anywhere       # allow SSH from anywhere
  ```

💡 If you find yourself locked out by mistake, you can connect a keyboard and screen to your PC to log in locally and fix these settings (especially for the SSH port 22).

## Increase your open files limit

If your MiniBolt is swamped with internet requests (honest or malicious due to a DoS attack), you will quickly encounter the "can't accept connection: too many open files" error.
This is due to the limit of open files (representing individual TCP connections) set too low.

* Create the file `/etc/security/limits.d/90-limits.conf`, copy these lines into it, save and exit.

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /etc/security/limits.d/90-limits.conf
  ```

  ```
  *    soft nofile 128000
  *    hard nofile 128000
  root soft nofile 128000
  root hard nofile 128000
  ```

* Edit both of the following two files, add the additional line(s) right before the end comment, save and exit.

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-session
  ```

  ```
  session required                        pam_limits.so
  ```

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive
  ```

  ```
  session required                        pam_limits.so
  ```

## Monitoring SSH authentication logs

* You can monitor authentication general logs in your system in real-time

  ```sh
  $ sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
  ```

* Or filtering only by ssh authentication logs in the last 500 lines

  ```sh
  $ sudo tail --lines 500 /var/log/auth.log | grep sshd
  ```

* Discarding your connections from your regular computer in the local network

  ```sh
  $ sudo tail --lines 500 /var/log/auth.log | grep sshd | grep -v 192.168.X.XXX
  ```

* With this command, you can show a listing of the last satisfactory logged-in users in your MiniBolt since 7 days ago. Change `-7days` option to whatever you want

  ```sh
  $ last -s -7days -t today
  ```

In this way, you can detect a possible brute-force attack and take appropriate mitigation measures.

💡 Do this regularly to get security-related incidents.

## Prepare NGINX reverse proxy

Several components of this guide will expose a communication port, for example the Electrum server, the Block Explorer, or the "Ride The Lightning" web interface for your Lightning node.
Even if you use these services only within your own home network, communication should always be encrypted.
Otherwise, any device in the same network can listen to the exchanged data, including passwords.

We use NGINX to encrypt the communication with SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security).
This setup is called a "reverse proxy": NGINX provides secure communication to the outside and routes the traffic back to the internal service without encryption.

💡 _Hint: NGINX is pronounced "Engine X"_ ;)

* Install NGINX

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install nginx
  ```

* Create a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate (valid for 10 years)

  ```sh
  $ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt -subj "/CN=localhost" -days 3650
  ```

* NGINX is also a full web server.
  To use it only as a reverse proxy, remove the default configuration and paste the following configuration into the `nginx.conf` file. Save and exit.

  ```sh
  $ sudo mv /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.bak
  ```

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  ```

  ```nginx
  user www-data;
  worker_processes auto;
  pid /run/nginx.pid;
  include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

  events {
    worker_connections 768;
  }

  http {
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
    ssl_session_cache shared:HTTP-TLS:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout 4h;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*.conf;
  }

  stream {
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
    ssl_session_cache shared:STREAM-TLS:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout 4h;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    include /etc/nginx/streams-enabled/*.conf;
  }
  ```

* Create a new directory for future configuration files

  ```sh
  $ sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/streams-enabled
  ```

* Disable NGINX's default site

  ```sh
  $ sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
  ```

* Test this barebone Nginx configuration

  ```sh
  $ sudo nginx -t
  ```

Expected output:

  ```
  > nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
  > nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
  ```

* Reload Nginx to apply the configuration

  ```sh
  $ sudo systemctl reload nginx
  ```
