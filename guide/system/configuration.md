# System configuration

{: .no_toc }

---

You are now on the command line of your own Bitcoin node.
Let's start with the configuration.

---

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

---

## Add the admin user (and log in with it)

We will use the primary user "admin" instead of "temp" to make this guide more universal.

* Create a new user called "admin" with your `password [A]`

  ```sh
  $ sudo adduser --gecos "" admin
  ```

* Make this new user a superuser by adding it to the "sudo" and old "temp" user groups

  ```sh
  $ sudo usermod -a -G sudo,adm,cdrom,dip,plugdev,lxd admin
  ```

* Logout `temp` user

  ```sh
  $ logout
  ```

* Repeat [access with the SSH section](../system/remote-access#access-with-secure-shell) but this time login with `admin` and your `password [A]`

* Delete the `temp` user. Do not worry about the `userdel: temp mail spool (/var/mail/temp) not found` message

  ```sh
  $ sudo userdel -rf temp
  ```

Expected output:

  ```
  > userdel: temp mail spool (/var/mail/temp) not found
  ```

To change the system configuration and files that don't belong to the user "admin", you have to prefix commands with `sudo`.
You will be prompted to enter your admin `password [A]` from time to time for increased security.

## Login with SSH keys (optional)

Now, you can start to access it without a password by following the [SSH keys bonus guide](../bonus/system/ssh-keys.md).

## System update

* Update the operating system and all installed software packages

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
  ```

ðŸ’¡ Do this regularly every few months for security-related updates.
If during the update process, a banner appears asking you: "Which services should be restarted?" you can press ENTER and take note of which services will be restarted during the update, marked with `[*]`. Example:

![update action](../../images/update-action.PNG)

* To be able to use the "minibolt" hostname instead of the IP address, we must install this necessary software package

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install avahi-daemon
  ```

## Check drive performance

Performant unit storage is essential for your node.

Let's check if your drive works well as-is.

* Your disk should be detected as `/dev/sda`. Check if this is the case by listing the names of connected block devices

  ```sh
  $ lsblk -pli
  ```

* Measure the speed of your drive

  ```sh
  $ sudo hdparm -t --direct /dev/sda
  ```

**Example** of expected output:

  ```
  > Timing O_DIRECT disk reads: 932 MB in 3.00 seconds = 310.23 MB/sec
  ```

ðŸ’¡ If the measured speeds are more than 50 MB/s, you're good.

* If you installed a **secondary disk**, check and measure the speed with the next command, if not, skip it

  ```sh
  $ sudo hdparm -t --direct /dev/sdb
  ```

**Example** of expected output:

  ```
  > Timing O_DIRECT disk reads: 932 MB in 3.00 seconds = 310.23 MB/sec
  ```

ðŸ’¡ If the measured speeds are more than 50 MB/s, you're good.

## Data directory

We'll store all application data in the dedicated directory `/data`.
This allows for better security because it's not inside any user's home directory.
Additionally, it's easier to move that directory somewhere else, for instance to a separate drive, as you can just mount any storage option to `/data`.

ðŸ’¡ Remember the next command is not necessary if you previously followed the [Store data in a secondary disk](../bonus/system/store-data-secondary-disk.md#case-1-build-it-during-system-installation---recommended) bonus guide searching to store the data in a secondary disk; because the **(/data)** folder was previously created.

* Create the data folder

  ```sh
  $ sudo mkdir /data
  ```

ðŸ’¡ If the prompt shows you: `mkdir: cannot create directory '/data': File exists` probably you followed [Store data in a secondary disk](../bonus/system/store-data-secondary-disk.md) bonus guide to use a secondary disk, then ignore it and follow with the next command.

* Assing to the `admin` user as the owner of the **(/data)** folder

  ```sh
  $ sudo chown admin:admin /data
  ```
