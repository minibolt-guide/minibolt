## Preparations

The installation of LND is straight-forward, but the application is quite powerful and capable of things not explained here. Check out their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/){:target="_blank"} for a wealth of information about their open-source project and Lightning in general.

### **Configure Bitcoin Core**

Before running LND, we need to set up settings in the Bitcoin Core configuration file to enable the LND RPC connection.

* Login as user "admin", edit `bitcoin.conf`, and add the following lines. Save and exit

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /data/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
  ```

  ```
  # LND RPC connection
  zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
  zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28333
  ```

* Restart Bitcoin Core to apply changes

  ```sh
  $ sudo systemctl restart bitcoind
  ```

## Installation

### **Download**

We'll download, verify and install LND.

* Navigate to the temporary directory which is cleared on reboot

  ```sh
  $ cd /tmp
  ```

* Set a temporary version environment variable to the installation

  ```sh
  $ VERSION=0.16.1
  ```

* Download the application, checksums and signature

  ```sh
  $ wget https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/download/v$VERSION-beta/lnd-linux-amd64-v$VERSION-beta.tar.gz
  ```

  ```sh
  $ wget https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/download/v$VERSION-beta/manifest-v$VERSION-beta.txt
  ```

  ```sh
  $ wget https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/download/v$VERSION-beta/manifest-roasbeef-v$VERSION-beta.sig.ots
  ```

  ```sh
  $ wget https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/download/v$VERSION-beta/manifest-roasbeef-v$VERSION-beta.sig
  ```

### **Checksum check**

* Verify the signed checksum against the actual checksum of your download

  ```sh
  $ sha256sum --check manifest-v$VERSION-beta.txt --ignore-missing
  ```

Expected output:

  ```
  > lnd-linux-amd64-v$VERSION-beta.tar.gz: OK
  ```

### **Signature check**

Now that we've verified the integrity of the downloaded binary, we need to check the authenticity of the manifest file we just used, starting with its signature.

* Get the public key from the LND developer, [Olaoluwa Osuntokun](https://keybase.io/roasbeef){:target="_blank"}, who signed the manifest file; and add it to your GPG keyring

  ```sh
  $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/master/scripts/keys/roasbeef.asc | gpg --import
  ```

Expected output:

  ```
  > [...]
  > gpg: key 372CBD7633C61696: public key "Olaoluwa Osuntokun <laolu32@gmail.com>" imported/not changed
  > [...]
  ```

* Verify the signature of the text file containing the checksums for the application

  ```sh
  $ gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v$VERSION-beta.sig manifest-v$VERSION-beta.txt
  ```

Expected output:

  ```
  [...]
  > gpg: Signature made Thu Dec  1 19:20:10 2022 UTC
  > gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
  > gpg: Good signature from "Olaoluwa Osuntokun <laolu32@gmail.com>" [unknown]
  > gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
  [...]
  ```

### **Timestamp check**

We can also check that the manifest file was in existence around the time of the release using its timestamp.

* Let's verify the timestamp of the file matches the release date

  ```sh
  $ ots --no-cache verify manifest-roasbeef-v$VERSION-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v$VERSION-beta.sig
  ```

**Example** of expected output:

  ```
  > Got 1 attestation(s) from https://alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org
  > Got 1 attestation(s) from https://btc.calendar.catallaxy.com
  > Got 1 attestation(s) from https://finney.calendar.eternitywall.com
  > Got 1 attestation(s) from https://bob.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org
  > Success! Bitcoin block 765521 attests existence as of 2022-12-01 UTC
  ```

💡 Check that the date of the timestamp is close to the [release date](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases){:target="_blank"} of the LND binary.

### **Installation**

Having verified the integrity and authenticity of the release binary, we can safely proceed to install it

  ```sh
  $ tar -xvf lnd-linux-amd64-v$VERSION-beta.tar.gz
  ```

  ```sh
  $ sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin lnd-linux-amd64-v$VERSION-beta/*
  ```

  ```sh
  $ lnd --version
  ```

Expected output:

  ```
  > lnd version $VERSION-beta commit=v$VERSION-beta
  ```

### **Data directory**

Now that LND is installed, we need to configure it to work with Bitcoin Core and run automatically on startup.

* Create the **"lnd"** service user, and add it to the groups "bitcoin" and "debian-tor"

  ```sh
  $ sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" lnd
  ```

  ```sh
  $ sudo usermod -a -G bitcoin,debian-tor lnd
  ```

* Add the user "admin" to the group "lnd"

  ```sh
  $ sudo adduser admin lnd
  ```

* Create the LND data directory

  ```sh
  $ sudo mkdir /data/lnd
  ```

  ```sh
  $ sudo chown -R lnd:lnd /data/lnd
  ```

* Open a "lnd" user session

  ```sh
  $ sudo su - lnd
  ```

* Create symbolic links pointing to the LND and bitcoin data directories

  ```sh
  $ ln -s /data/lnd /home/lnd/.lnd
  ```

  ```sh
  $ ln -s /data/bitcoin /home/lnd/.bitcoin
  ```

### **Wallet password**

LND includes a Bitcoin wallet that manages your on-chain and Lightning coins.
It is password protected and must be unlocked when LND starts.
This creates the dilemma that you either manually unlock LND after each restart of your PC, or you store the password somewhere on the node.

For this initial setup, we choose the easy route: we store the password in a file that allows LND to unlock the wallet automatically.
This is not the most secure setup, but you can improve it later if you want, with the bonus guides linked below.
To give some perspective: other Lightning implementations like c-lightning or Eclair don't even have a password.

* As user **"lnd"**, create a text file and enter your LND wallet `password [C]`. Save and exit.

  ```sh
  $ nano /data/lnd/password.txt
  ```

* Tighten access privileges and make the file readable only for user "lnd"

  ```sh
  $ chmod 600 /data/lnd/password.txt
  ```

## Configuration

### **Configure LND**

* Create the LND configuration file and paste the following content ***(adjust to your alias `"<YOUR_FANCY_ALIAS>"`, your preferred color `"<#ff9900>"`, your minimum channel size `"minchansize"` and fees)***. Save and exit.

  ```sh
  $ nano /data/lnd/lnd.conf
  ```

  ```

  ```

🔍 This is a standard configuration. Check the official LND [sample-lnd.conf](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/sample-lnd.conf){:target="_blank"} with all possible options

* Exit "lnd" user session to return to the **"admin"** user session

  ```sh
  $ exit
  ```

### **Autostart on boot**

Now, let's set up LND to start automatically on system startup.

* As user `admin`, create LND systemd unit with the following content. Save and exit.

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lnd.service
  ```

  ```
  # MiniBolt: systemd unit for lnd
  # /etc/systemd/system/lnd.service

  [Unit]
  Description=LND Lightning Network Daemon
  After=bitcoind.service
  PartOf=bitcoind.service

  [Service]
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/lnd
  ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/lncli stop

  MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```

* Enable the service

  ```sh
  $ sudo systemctl enable lnd
  ```

* Now, the daemon information is no longer displayed on the command line but is written into the system journal.
  You can check on it using the following command.

  ```sh
  $ sudo journalctl -f -u lnd
  ```

## Run LND

[Start your SSH program](../system/remote-access.md#access-with-secure-shell) (eg. PuTTY) a second time, connect to the PC and log in as "admin".
Commands for the **second session** start with the prompt `$2` (which must not be entered).

* Start LND

```sh
$2 sudo systemctl start lnd
```

Monitor the systemd journal at the first session created to check if everything works fine. You can exit monitoring at any time with `Ctrl-C`

Expected output:

  ```

### **Wallet setup**

Once LND is started, the process waits for us to create the integrated Bitcoin onchain wallet.

* Change to "lnd" user

  ```sh
  $2 sudo su - lnd
  ```

* Create the LND wallet

  ```sh
  $2 lncli create
  ```

* Enter your `password [C]` as wallet password (it must be exactly the same you stored in `password.txt`).
  To create a a new wallet, select `n` when asked if you have an existing cipher seed.
  Just press enter if asked about an additional seed passphrase, unless you know what you're doing.
  A new cipher seed consisting of 24 words is created.

  ```
  Do you have an existing cipher seed mnemonic or extended master root key you want to use?
  Enter 'y' to use an existing cipher seed mnemonic, 'x' to use an extended master root key
  or 'n' to create a new seed (Enter y/x/n): n

  Your cipher seed can optionally be encrypted.
  Input your passphrase if you wish to encrypt it (or press enter to proceed without a cipher seed passphrase):

  Generating fresh cipher seed...

  !!!YOU MUST WRITE DOWN THIS SEED TO BE ABLE TO RESTORE THE WALLET!!!

  ---------------BEGIN LND CIPHER SEED---------------
  1. secret     2. secret    3. secret     4. secret
  ...
  ```

These 24 words is all that you need to restore the Bitcoin on-chain wallet.

* **Write these 24 words down manually on a piece of paper and store it in a safe place.**

You can use a simple piece of paper, write them on the custom themed [Shiftcrypto backup card](https://shiftcrypto.ch/backupcard/backupcard_print.pdf){:target="_blank"}, or even [stamp the seed words into metal](../bonus/bitcoin/safu-ninja.md).

🚨 This piece of paper is all an attacker needs to completely empty your on-chain wallet!
🚫 Do not store it on a computer.
🚫 Do not take a picture with your mobile phone.
🚫 **This information should never be stored anywhere in digital form.**

The current state of your channels, however, cannot be recreated from this seed.
For this, the Static Channel Backup stored at `/data/lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/channel.backup` is updated for each channel opening and closing. Exist a dedicate [guide](../lightning/channel-backup.md) to automatic backup this.

🚨 This information must be kept secret at all times.

### **Allow user "admin" to work with LND**

We interact with LND using the application `lncli`.
At the moment, only the user "lnd" has the necessary access privileges.
To make the user "admin" the main administrative user, we make sure it can interact with LND as well.

* Type "exit" to return to the admin user

  ```sh
  $2 exit
  ```

* As user "admin", link the LND data directory in the user "admin" home.
  As a member of the group "lnd", admin has read-only access to certain files.
  We also need to make all directories browsable for the group (with `g+X`) and allow it to read the file `admin.macaroon`

  ```sh
  $2 ln -s /data/lnd /home/admin/.lnd
  ```

  ```sh
  $2 sudo chmod -R g+X /data/lnd/data/
  ```

  ```sh
  $2 sudo chmod g+r /data/lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon
  ```

* Newly added links and permissions become active only in a new user session. Log out from SSH.

  ```sh
  $2 exit
  ```

* Log in as user **“admin”** again `"ssh admin@minibolt.local"`

* Check if you can use `lncli` by querying LND for information

  ```sh
  $2 lncli getinfo
  ```

## LND in action

💊 Now your Lightning node is ready. This is also the point of no return. Up until now, you can just start over. Once you send real bitcoin to your MiniBolt, you have "skin in the game"

💡 The next commands can be entered in any new session without keeping a specific terminal opened with logs, but I recommend keeping to do this just in case any log could give extra information about the command you just entered.

### **Watchtower client**

Lightning channels need to be monitored to prevent malicious behavior by your channel peers.
If your MiniBolt goes down for a longer period of time, for instance, due to a hardware problem, a node on the other side of one of your channels might try to close the channel with an earlier channel balance that is better for them.

Watchtowers are other Lightning nodes that can monitor your channels for you.
If they detect such bad behavior, they can react on your behalf, and send a punishing transaction to close this channel.
In this case, all channel funds will be sent to your LND on-chain wallet.

A watchtower can only send such a punishing transaction to your wallet, so you don't have to trust them.
It's good practice to add a few watchtowers, just to be on the safe side.

* With user `"admin"`, add the [Lightning Network+ watchtower](https://lightningnetwork.plus/watchtower){:target="_blank"} Tor address as a first example

  ```sh
  $ lncli wtclient add 023bad37e5795654cecc69b43599da8bd5789ac633c098253f60494bde602b60bf@iiu4epqzm6cydqhezueenccjlyzrqeruntlzbx47mlmdgfwgtrll66qd.onion:9911
  ```

* Or the clearnet address

  ```sh
  $ lncli wtclient add 023bad37e5795654cecc69b43599da8bd5789ac633c098253f60494bde602b60bf@34.216.52.158:9911
  ```

* If you want to list your towers and active watchtowers

  ```sh
  $ lncli wtclient towers
  ```

Expected output:

  ```
  {
      "towers": [
          {
              "pubkey": "023bad37e5795654cecc69b43599da8bd5789ac633c098253f60494bde602b60bf",
              "addresses": [
                  "iiu4epqzm6cydqhezueenccjlyzrqeruntlzbx47mlmdgfwgtrll66qd.onion:9911"
              ],
              "active_session_candidate": true,
              "num_sessions": 0,
              "sessions": [
              ]
          },
      ]
  }
  ```

* If you want to deactivate an active tower

  ```sh
  $ lncli wtclient remove <pubkey>
  ```

### **Watchtower server**

Same as you can connect as a watchtower client to other watchtower servers, you could give the same service running an altruist watchtower server. This was previously activated in `lnd.conf`, and you can see the information about it by typing the following command and sharing it with your peers.

  ```sh
  $ lncli tower info
  ```

Example output:

  ```sh
  {
    "pubkey": "023bad37e5795654cecc69b43599da8bd5789ac633c098253f60494bde602b60bf",
    "listeners": [
        "[::]:9911"
    ],
    "uris": [
        "iiu4epqzm6cydqhezueenccjlyzrqeruntlzbx47mlmdgfwgtrll66qd.onion:9911"
    ]
  }

  ```

⚠️ This service is not recommended to activate if you have a slow device without high-performance features, if yes considered to disable it.

💡 Almost all of the following steps could be run with the [mobile](../lightning/mobile-app.md)/[web](../lightning/web-app.md) app guides

### **Funding your Lightning node**

* Generate a new Bitcoin address (p2tr = taproot/bech32m) to receive funds on-chain and send a small amount of Bitcoin to it from any wallet of your choice.

  ```sh
  $ lncli newaddress p2tr
  ```

Expected output:

  ```
  > "address": "bc1p..."
  ```

* Check your LND wallet balance. (The output is only an example)

  ```sh
  $ lncli walletbalance
  ```

Expected output:

  ```
  {
      "total_balance": "712345",
      "confirmed_balance": "0",
      "unconfirmed_balance": "712345"
  }
  ```

As soon as your funding transaction is mined (1 confirmation), LND will show its amount as "confirmed_balance".

💡 If you want to open a few channels, you might want to send a few transactions.
If you have only one UTXO, you need to wait for the change to return to your wallet after every new channel opening.

### **Opening channels**

Although LND features an optional "autopilot", we manually open some channels.

We recommend going on [Amboss.Space](https://www.amboss.space/){:target="_blank"} or [1ML.com](https://1ml.com){:target="_blank"} and look for a mix of big and small nodes with decent Node Ranks.
Another great way to find peers to collaboratively set up channels is [LightningNetwork+](https://lightningnetwork.plus/){:target="_blank"}.

To connect to a remote node, you need its URI that looks like `<pubkey>@host`:

* the `<pubkey>` is just a long hexadecimal number, like `02b03a1d133c0338c0185e57f0c35c63cce53d5e3ae18414fc40e5b63ca08a2128`
* the `host` can be a domain name, a clearnet ip address or a Tor onion address, followed by the port number (usually `:9735`)

Just grab the whole URI above the big QR code and use it as follows (we will use the `⚡2FakTor⚡` node as an example):

* **Connect** to the remote node, with the full URI.

  ```sh
  $ lncli connect 02b03a1d133c0338c0185e57f0c35c63cce53d5e3ae18414fc40e5b63ca08a2128@aopvxn7cf7kv42u5oxfo3mplhl5oerukndi3wos7vpsfvqvc7vvmgyqd.onion:9735
  ```

* **Open a channel** using the `<pubkey>` only (*i.e.*, the part of the URI before the `@`) and the channel capacity in satoshis.

  One Bitcoin equals 100 million satoshis, so at $10'000/BTC, $10 amount to 0.001 BTC or 100'000 satoshis.
  To avoid mistakes, you can just use an [online converter](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/satoshi/to-usd/){:target="_blank"}.

  The command has a built-in fee estimator, but to avoid overpaying fees, you can manually control the fees for the funding transaction by using the `sat_per_vbyte` argument as follows (to select the appropriate fee, in sats/vB, check [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/){:target="_blank"})

  ```sh
  $ lncli openchannel --sat_per_vbyte 8 02b03a1d133c0338c0185e57f0c35c63cce53d5e3ae18414fc40e5b63ca08a2128 100000 0
  ```

* **Check your funds**, both in the on-chain wallet and the channel balances.

  ```sh
  $ lncli walletbalance
  ```

  ```sh
  $ lncli channelbalance
  ```

* **List active channels**. Once the channel funding transaction has been mined and gained enough confirmations, your channel is fully operational.
  That can take an hour or more.

  ```sh
  $ lncli listchannels
  ```

* **Make a Lightning payment**. By default, these work with invoices, so when you buy something or want to send money, you need to get an invoice first. However, you can also pay without requesting an invoice as long the receiving node supports the keysend or amp feature!

To try, why not send me satoshis! You simply need to input my node pukey [`⚡2FakTor⚡`](https://amboss.space/node/02b03a1d133c0338c0185e57f0c35c63cce53d5e3ae18414fc40e5b63ca08a2128){:target="_blank"}, the amount in satoshis and add the –keysend flag

  ```sh
  $ lncli sendpayment --dest 02b03a1d133c0338c0185e57f0c35c63cce53d5e3ae18414fc40e5b63ca08a2128 --amt <amount in sats whatever you want> --keysend
  ```

### **More commands**

A quick reference with common commands to play around with:

* list all arguments for the CLI (command line interface)

  ```sh
  $ lncli
  ```

* get help for a specific command

  ```sh
  $ lncli help [COMMAND]
  ```

* Find out some general stats about your node:

  ```sh
  $ lncli getinfo
  ```

* Check the peers you are currently connected to:

  ```sh
  $ lncli listpeers
  ```

* Check the status of your pending channels:

  ```sh
  $ lncli pendingchannels
  ```

* Check the status of your active channels:

  ```sh
  $ lncli listchannels
  ```

* Before paying an invoice, you should decode it to check if the amount and other info are correct:

  ```sh
  $ lncli decodepayreq [INVOICE]
  ```

* Pay an invoice:

  ```sh
  $ lncli payinvoice [INVOICE]
  ```

  ```sh
  $ lncli closechannel --force [FUNDING_TXID] [OUTPUT_INDEX]
  ```
