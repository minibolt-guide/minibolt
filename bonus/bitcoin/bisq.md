# Bisq

[Bisq](https://bisq.network/) is a decentralized bitcoin exchange. It is a desktop application that aims at providing a secure, private, and censorship-resistant way of exchanging bitcoin for national currencies and other cryptocurrencies over the internet.

{% endhint %}

## Requirements

* [Bitcoin Core](../../bitcoin/bitcoin/bitcoin-client.md)

## Introduction

The guide will show you how to:

1. Configure BTC Core to allow Bisq to run its SPV wallet
2. Install Bisq on your personal computer
3. Connect Bisq to your Bitcoin Core node in your local network or via remote Tor, and depending on your OS and  personal computer
4. Securely set up Bisq

## Preparations

### Configure Bitcoin Core

* To connect Bisq from your personal computer in your local network, with the user `admin`, edit the `bitcoin.conf` file

```bash
sudo nano /data/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
```

* Replace the `bind=127.0.0.1` line with the next to allow connections from anywhere

<pre><code><strong>bind=0.0.0.0
</strong></code></pre>

Or add under `bind=127.0.0.1` line this line, to allow connections only from devices in the same local network (**recommended option** to improve the security)

<pre><code>bind=<a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">192.168.x.x</a>
</code></pre>

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember to replace `192.168.x.x` with your MiniBolt local IP, i.e `192.168.1.43`
{% endhint %}

* Add `peerbloomfilters=1` to activate the bloom filters and whitelist our P2P connection. Save and exit

```
# Support filtering of blocks and transactions with bloom filters
peerbloomfilters=1

# Whitelist our local network & Wireguard VPN P2P connections
whitelist=bloomfilter@192.168.0.0/16
whitelist=bloomfilter@10.0.0.0/16
```

* Restart Bitcoin Core to apply changes

```bash
sudo systemctl restart bitcoind
```

### Obtain your Bitcoin Core `onion` address

* With the `admin` or `bitcoin` user, run the following command and make a copy of the .onion address and port (e.g. here, `123...abc.onion:8333`)

```sh
bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | grep address.*onion
```

**Example** of expected output:

```
"address": "123...abc.onion:8333"
```

### Configure Firewall

* Configure the firewall to allow incoming requests to Bitcoin Core from anywhere

```sh
sudo ufw allow 8333/tcp comment 'allow Bitcoin Core from anywhere'
```

## Installation

* [Download ](https://bisq.network/downloads/)Bisq on your personal computer using the appropriate binary for your OS
* Verify the downloaded binary following [Bisq guidelines](https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing)
* Once you've verified the integrity of the downloaded Bisq binary, install it on your personal computer but do NOT launch Bisq yet!

## Connect Bisq to your node

For Linux and MacOS, we will start Bisq for the first time using the command line to force it to connect to your Bitcoin node only.

On your personal computer where you installed Bisq, depending on your OS

**For Linux:**

* Open a command line terminal, we will start Bisq with two flags that will force it to connect to our node only. Bisq should connect to your node on the startup

From the local network connection, replace `192.168.X.X:8333` it with your node IP address.

```sh
/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq -btcNodes=192.168.X.X:8333 -useTorForBtc=false
```

From the remote connection, replace `123...abc.onion:8333` with your Bitcoin Core .onion address you obtained above

```sh
/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq -btcNodes=123...abc.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true
```

* Wait a few minutes until Bisq is up to date with the current state of the blockchain and go back to "Settings" > "Network info" to check that only your own node local IP address or onion address is listed in the first table
* Check that the "Bitcoin network peers" counter at the bottom right of the window is equal to 1

**For MacOS:**

* Open a command line terminal, we will start Bisq with two flags that will force it to connect to our node only
* From the local network connection, replace `192.168.X.X:8333` with your node IP address

```sh
Bisq -btcNodes=192.168.X.X:8333 -useTorForBtc=false
```

* From the remote connection, replace `123...abc.onion:8333` with your own Bitcoin Core .onion address that you obtained above

```sh
Bisq -btcNodes=123...abc.onion:8333 -useTorForBtc=true
```

* Wait a few minutes until Bisq is up to date with the current state of the blockchain and go back to "Settings" > "Network info" to check that only your own node local IP address or onion address is listed in the first table
* Check that the "Bitcoin network peers" counter at the bottom right of the window is equal to 1

**For Windows**, Bisq is automatically opened using the GUI, we can't start Bisq the first time using the command line to force it to connect to your Bitcoin node only, so it will connect to several remote Bitcoin nodes via Tor, don't worry, we are going to change fastly this configuration:

* Start Bisq using the GUI icon
* Click on the "Settings" > "Network info" tab
* In the "Bitcoin Network" section, click on "Use custom Bitcoin Core nodes"
* In the box just below, paste your node IP address (`192.168.X.X`) or Bitcoin Core node `.onion` address `(e.g: 123...abc.onion:8333)` that you obtained above, depending if you are connecting locally or remotely via Tor
* Check/uncheck "Use Tor for Bitcoin network" under Settings > Network, depending if you are connecting locally or remotely via Tor
* Click on any other tab at the top. Bisq will ask you to shutdown the program to make your change effective
* Click "Shutdown"
* Start Bisq again using the GUI icon
* Wait a few minutes until Bisq is up to date with the current state of the blockchain and go back to "Settings" > "Network info" to check that only your own node local IP address or onion address is listed in the first table
* Check that the "Bitcoin network peers" counter at the bottom right of the window is equal to 1

{% hint style="success" %}
Congrats! Bisq is now connected to your node
