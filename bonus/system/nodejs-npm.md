## Installation

* With user `admin`, update the packages and upgrade to keep up to date with the OS, press "**y**" and "**enter**" when needed

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
```

* Change to a temporary directory that is cleared on reboot

```bash
cd /tmp
```

* Set the environment variable for the version

```bash
VERSION=22
```

* We will use the NodeSource Node.js Binary Distributions [repository](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) instructions. Download the setup script

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sh
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_$VERSION.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
```
{% endcode %}

* Run the setup script

```bash
sudo -E bash nodesource_setup.sh
```

* Update the package manager and install Node.js + NPM. Press "**y**" and `enter` or directly `enter` if the prompt asks you

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs
```

* Check the correct installation of Node.js

```sh
node -v
```

**Example** of expected output:

```
v18.16.0
```

* Check the correct installation of NPM

```sh
npm -v
```
