<pre><code>info: downloading installer

Welcome to Rust!

This will download and install the official compiler for the Rust
programming language, and its package manager, Cargo.

Rustup metadata and toolchains will be installed into the Rustup
home directory, located at:

  /home/admin/.rustup

This can be modified with the RUSTUP_HOME environment variable.

The Cargo home directory is located at:

  /home/admin/.cargo

This can be modified with the CARGO_HOME environment variable.

The cargo, rustc, rustup and other commands will be added to
Cargo's bin directory, located at:

  /home/admin/.cargo/bin

This path will then be added to your PATH environment variable by
modifying the profile files located at:

  /home/admin/.profile
  /home/admin/.bashrc

You can uninstall at any time with rustup self uninstall and
these changes will be reverted.

Current installation options:


   default host triple: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
     default toolchain: stable (default)
               profile: default
  modify PATH variable: yes

1) Proceed with installation (default)
2) Customize installation
3) Cancel installation

  stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu installed - rustc 1.71.0 (8ede3aae2 2023-07-12)


Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, run:
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

</details>

{% hint style="info" %}
This process can take quite **a long time**, 10-15 minutes or more, depending on the performance of your device. Please be patient until the prompt shows again
{% endhint %}

* Configure your current shell to reload your PATH environment variable to include Cargo's bin directory (`$HOME/.cargo/bin`)

```bash
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

* Now check the correct installation of Rustup

```bash
rustc --version
```

**Example** of expected output:

```
rustc 1.71.0 (8ede3aae2 2023-07-12)
```

* And cargo

```bash
cargo -V
```

**Example** of expected output:

```
cargo 1.71.0 (cfd3bbd8f 2023-06-08)
```

## Upgrade

* With user `admin` type the appropriate command to get that

```bash
rustup update
```

Expected output:

```
info: syncing channel updates for 'stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'
info: checking for self-update
[...]
```

## Uninstall

* With user `admin` type the appropriate command to get that

```bash
rustup self uninstall
```

Expected output:

```
Thanks for hacking in Rust!

This will uninstall all Rust toolchains and data, and remove
$HOME/.cargo/bin from your PATH environment variable.
Continue? (y/N)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Press "`y"` and enter
{% endhint %}

Expected output:

```
info: removing rustup home
info: removing cargo home
info: removing rustup binaries
info: rustup is uninstalled
```
